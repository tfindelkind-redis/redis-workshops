## ü§ù Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment. Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

## üöÄ How to Contribute

There are several ways to contribute:

1. **Create new workshops** - Design complete learning experiences
2. **Create new chapters** - Add reusable learning modules
3. **Improve existing content** - Fix errors, clarify instructions, add examples
4. **Report issues** - Point out bugs, unclear instructions, or errors
5. **Suggest enhancements** - Propose new features or improvements

## üé® Creating Workshops

### Quick Start

Use our automation tool that **automatically creates a new branch** for your workshop:

```bash
./shared/tools/create-workshop.sh "Your Workshop Name"
```

**What this does:**
- ‚úÖ Creates a new branch: `workshop/your-workshop-name`
- ‚úÖ Generates workshop structure from template
- ‚úÖ Sets up initial README.md with frontmatter
- ‚úÖ Auto-generates workshop.config.json

**Important:** You are now on a new branch! All your workshop work should be done on this branch before creating a Pull Request.

### Workshop Development Workflow

1. **Create workshop** (automatically creates branch)
   ```bash
   ./shared/tools/create-workshop.sh "Your Workshop Name"
   ```

2. **Edit workshop content**
   ```bash
   cd workshops/your-workshop-name
   # Edit README.md frontmatter and content
   ```

3. **Sync configuration**
   ```bash
   ./shared/tools/sync-workshop-config.sh workshops/your-workshop-name
   ```

4. **Validate workshop**
   ```bash
   ./shared/tools/validate-workshop.sh workshops/your-workshop-name
   ```

5. **Commit changes**
   ```bash
   git add workshops/your-workshop-name
   git commit -m "Add Your Workshop Name workshop"
   ```

6. **Push and create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin workshop/your-workshop-name
   # Then create a PR on GitHub to merge into main
   ```

### Workshop Structure

A workshop should include:

```
workshops/your-workshop/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    # Main workshop guide
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workshop.config.json         # Workshop configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.sh                     # Setup script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/                      # Workshop-specific resources
```

### Workshop Guidelines

1. **Clear Learning Path**: Define clear objectives and prerequisites
2. **Appropriate Duration**: Aim for 2-6 hours total
3. **Hands-On Focus**: Include practical exercises
4. **Progressive Difficulty**: Build from simple to complex
5. **Reuse Chapters**: Reference existing chapters when possible

See [Workshop Creation Guide](workshop-creation-guide.md) for detailed instructions.

## üìö Creating Chapters

### Quick Start

Use our automation tool:

```bash
./shared/tools/create-chapter.sh "Your Chapter Name"
```

This creates a chapter structure from the template.

### Chapter Structure

A chapter should include:

```
shared/chapters/chapter-XX-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                           # Chapter content
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .chapter-metadata.json              # Metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.sh                       # Setup script
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cleanup.sh                     # Cleanup script
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ demo.sh                        # Demo script
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ solutions/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ exercise-*.sh              # Exercise solutions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/                            # Images, diagrams
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ answers.md                         # Knowledge check answers
```

### Chapter Guidelines

1. **Self-Contained**: Each chapter should work independently
2. **Clear Objectives**: State what learners will achieve
3. **Estimated Time**: Provide realistic time estimates (30-90 minutes)
4. **Hands-On Exercises**: Include at least 2-3 practical exercises
5. **Knowledge Checks**: Add quiz questions to reinforce learning
6. **Versioning**: Update version and changelog for changes

See [Chapter Authoring Guide](chapter-authoring-guide.md) for detailed instructions.
