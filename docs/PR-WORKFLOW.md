# Pull Request Workflow for Redis Workshops

This document explains the branch and Pull Request workflow for contributing workshops to the Redis Workshops repository.

## üåø Overview

All new workshops and significant changes **must go through a Pull Request** before merging to `main`. This ensures:

- ‚úÖ Code review and quality control
- ‚úÖ Validation before deployment
- ‚úÖ Collaborative feedback
- ‚úÖ Clean commit history
- ‚úÖ Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages

## üé® Creating a New Workshop

### Automatic Branch Creation

When you create a new workshop, the script **automatically creates a branch** for you:

```bash
./shared/tools/create-workshop.sh "My Workshop Name"
```

**What happens:**
1. ‚úÖ Creates branch: `workshop/my-workshop-name`
2. ‚úÖ Switches to the new branch
3. ‚úÖ Generates workshop structure
4. ‚úÖ Creates initial files from templates

You are now on a **feature branch** - all your work should be committed here.

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create workshop (auto-creates branch)
./shared/tools/create-workshop.sh "My Workshop Name"

# 2. You're now on branch: workshop/my-workshop-name
# Edit your workshop content
cd workshops/my-workshop-name
# Edit README.md frontmatter and content

# 3. Sync configuration from frontmatter
./shared/tools/sync-workshop-config.sh workshops/my-workshop-name

# 4. Validate your work
./shared/tools/validate-workshop.sh workshops/my-workshop-name

# 5. Commit changes
git add workshops/my-workshop-name
git commit -m "Add My Workshop Name workshop"

# 6. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin workshop/my-workshop-name

# 7. Create Pull Request on GitHub
# Go to: https://github.com/tfindelkind-redis/redis-workshops
# Click "Compare & pull request"
```

## üìñ Adding Chapters to Your Workshop

### Workshop-Specific Chapters

```bash
# While on your workshop branch
./shared/tools/create-chapter.sh "Chapter Name" --workshop="my-workshop-name"

# Add to frontmatter in README.md
# chapters: ..., workshops/my-workshop-name/chapters/chapter-name

# Sync and commit
./shared/tools/sync-workshop-config.sh workshops/my-workshop-name
git add workshops/my-workshop-name
git commit -m "Add Chapter Name chapter"
git push
```

### Using Shared Chapters

```bash
# Just add to frontmatter (no creation needed)
# chapters: shared/chapters/chapter-01-getting-started, ...

# Sync and commit
./shared/tools/sync-workshop-config.sh workshops/my-workshop-name
git add workshops/my-workshop-name
git commit -m "Add shared chapter to workshop"
git push
```

```

## üöÄ After Merge

Once your PR is merged to `main`:

1. ‚úÖ **Automatic deployment** to GitHub Pages
2. ‚úÖ Workshop appears on website within minutes
3. ‚úÖ Workshop available to all users
4. ‚úÖ You can delete your feature branch

```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main
git pull

# Delete your feature branch (optional)
git branch -d workshop/my-workshop-name
git push origin --delete workshop/my-workshop-name
```

## üîÑ Updating Existing Workshops

For updates to existing workshops:

```bash
# Create update branch
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b update/workshop-name-description

# Make changes
cd workshops/workshop-name
# Edit files

# Sync and validate
./shared/tools/sync-workshop-config.sh workshops/workshop-name
./shared/tools/validate-workshop.sh workshops/workshop-name

# Commit and push
git add workshops/workshop-name
git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
git push -u origin update/workshop-name-description

# Create PR with title: "Update: Workshop Name - Description"
```

## üåø Branch Naming Convention

| Type | Branch Name | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| New Workshop | `workshop/{id}` | `workshop/redis-fundamentals` |
| New Chapter | `chapter/{name}` | `chapter/redis-streams` |
| Update | `update/{description}` | `update/fix-chapter-links` |
| Fix | `fix/{description}` | `fix/typo-in-readme` |
| Feature | `feature/{description}` | `feature/search-functionality` |

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå **Don't commit directly to `main`**
   - Always work on a feature branch
   - The script creates the branch automatically

2. ‚ùå **Don't manually edit `workshop.config.json`**
   - Edit README.md frontmatter
   - Run sync script to generate config

3. ‚ùå **Don't forget to sync before committing**
   - Always run sync after frontmatter changes
   - Config file must match frontmatter

4. ‚ùå **Don't skip validation**
   - Run validation before pushing
   - Fix all issues before creating PR

5. ‚ùå **Don't create large PRs**
   - One workshop per PR
   - Break large changes into smaller PRs

1. **Check Documentation**
   - `docs/workshop-creation-guide.md`
   - `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - `docs/README-FRONTMATTER.md`
